## Objective
The main objective of this project is to enhance the internet sales reporting system by utilizing visual dashboards. The project aims to provide insights into the sales performance, such as the products sold, clients, and sales trends over time. It also allows filtering of sales data based on salespersons, products, and customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was extracted from the Microsoft Adventure Works 2019 warehouse data. It contains relevant information about sales transactions, including products, clients, salespersons, and dates. The dataset is structured and organized to facilitate effective analysis and visualization.

## Data Cleansing and Transformation
To ensure the accuracy and quality of the data, a thorough data cleansing and transformation process was performed. SQL was used to clean the dataset, removing any inconsistencies or errors. The data was transformed to create a structured and standardized format suitable for analysis.

## Visualizing Dashboards
The data analysis and visualization were performed using Power BI. The extracted and transformed dataset was imported into Power BI, and a set of interactive dashboards and reports were created. These dashboards provide a visual representation of sales performance, allowing users to explore various aspects of the sales data. The dashboards enable filtering based on salespersons, products, customers, and other relevant criteria.
